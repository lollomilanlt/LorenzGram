# Instagram Clone With CakePhp 4.x

Tweaking with the latest version of CakePhp framework I thought that a locally Instagram clone would be a funny thing. 
Anyway I designed the database before making the notifications component so you may think now that this project is outdated and it will die in his current status.
Probably yes but in my free time I might finish that.
Meanwhile I leave it public on my GitHub profile.

You may need to change the routes tho display the right page in the default spot.
